### Introduction

There are roughly fifty different species distributed naturally in Africa, Asia, Australia, Central America, Mexico and South America most of which are shrubs or trees. The flowers resemble hollyhock flowers and come in yellow, red, or white.  Early taxonomists struggled to classify members of the genus Gossypium due to the extensive diversification into many varieties through artificial selection. In the first edition of Species Plantarum, Carl Linnaeus recognized three species in 1753: _G. herbaceum, G. barbadense_, and _G. arboreum_. Of Asian origin, G. herbaceum bears attractive yellow flowers with a purple spot near the base of each petal where it narrows to the attachment point. Of the cotton plants from India, it is the most important.  Sea Island cotton (_G. barbadense_) with its particularly long and soft hairs originated in the Andes and became widely grown in the West Indies and on islands off the coast of Georgia and North Carolina.  Several varieties of G. barbadense are referred to as Egyptian cottons, the cloth of which is prized for its silky softness. Tree cotton (_G. arboreum_) is native to Africa and grows up to 20 feet tall. Limited cultivation of this species occurs in India outside its native range.  Currently the most widely planted species, American upland cotton (G. hirsutum) originated in Central America and Mexico later became the dominant species grown in the American South. Linnaeus never actually saw any taxa from the Americas; his later description of American upland cotton was based on a written account not direct observation.

## History 

Historical accounts of [*American cotton*](https://powo.science.kew.org/taxon/urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:30042843-2) focus on men. This essay seeks to re-place women and girls in the cotton landscapes of the American South as farmers, producers, consumers, capitalists, activists, experts, diplomats, and propaganda operatives. Enslaved African-American women performed a significant amount of the field labor required to produce cotton prior to the Civil War and, according to historical records, they sometimes out performed African-American men in their productivity. The popularity of cotton as a consumer good drove increasing demand which in turn catalyzed increasing reliance on enslaved labor beginning in the late 18th century. In opposition, relatively small but vocal groups of Christian women, particularly Quakers, in the U.S. attempted to pressure men in power to end slavery based on moral grounds. Among various strategies, they tried to use the power of the purse by refusing to purchase slave-grown cotton consumer goods. Allied British women amassed more support and enjoyed more immediate results from their efforts. Nevertheless, this early social movement fostered interracial alliances and societies desegregated by gender in support of abolition. 

After President Abraham Lincoln’s 1863 Emancipation Proclamation freed African American slaves, the U.S. retained and reconfigured racialized labor during the antebellum years. While African Americans continued to dominate as field laborers, white, mostly female wage laborers dominated in industrialized textile production in the New South. Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute’s George Washington Carver worked to uplift black farmers through scientific expertise to diversify their crops for increased self-sufficiency and to simultaneously improve cotton production per acre while reducing the acreage devoted to cash crops. Carver believed black families adopting conservation principles depended on female family members for their economic success. The nature of field labor morphed significantly beginning in the 1940s with increasingly mechanized agricultural production. However, poor women and their children continued to work as farm laborers albeit in diminishing numbers. Housewifization in African American communities also contributed to a reduction in the black female labor force in cotton production. However, the paid and unpaid labor of black women through their domestic work and kitchen gardens, subsidized the cotton industry which under paid men. Tuskegee began training women in “poultry raising, market gardening, bee-keeping, horticulture” and other aspects of agriculture after Booker T. Washington was inspired by a visit to the Woman’s Agricultural College at Swanley in England. 

When women attempted to speak out against civil rights abuses in the cotton-based political economic system, efforts to silence them repeatedly shifted. By the 20th century, cotton fabric marketers put objectified, young white women to work in support of a racialized and class-stratified cotton industry. Drawing from agricultural reports, archival research notes, historic photographs, letters, maps, political cartoons, and trade journals, I argue that, in addition to its role in maintaining racialized labor regimes, American cotton was used to promote heteronormativity in the service of capital accumulation. Simultaneously, gender essentialism was used to empower the fight against slavery and white supremacy.
